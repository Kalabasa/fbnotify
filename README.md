Facebook Notifier
=================

*fbnotify* ~~is~~ will be a cross-platform Facebook notifier using Python. 

This is still incomplete and in-development!

It runs in the background and notifies you whenever you get a notification in Facebook. No need to open the browser. Notifications come to you instead of you coming for them.

Installation
------------

Copy everything to anywhere.

Usage
-----

Use at your own risk. This is a work-in-progress.

`./main.py` or `python main.py`

Plugins
-------

There is a plugin system to aid in making it cross-platform.
